## Installation

To set up the project and run the simulations, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/Pi-Fy/Pi-Resonance-Harmonics.git
cd Pi-Resonance-Harmonics

markdown
Copy

2. **Install required dependencies** (Python libraries used in the simulations):
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib qiskit


markdown
Copy

3. **Verify installation** by running:
python --version


csharp
Copy
and checking that Python is installed correctly.



## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the simulations using the provided scripts.

Run the Fourier Spectrum Simulation
python scripts/fourier_analysis.py --input data/sample.csv --output figures/fourier_output.png

Run the Quantum Circuit Simulation
python scripts/quantum_circuit_sim.py

Run the Phase Evolution Plot
python scripts/phase_evolution.py

Results will be saved in the /figures/ directory
